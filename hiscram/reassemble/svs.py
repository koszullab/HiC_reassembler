# Class used to represent the SVs detected.

class SVs(object):
    """
    This class allows to represent SVs detected with its principal characterics.
    It will be really useful during the reassembly. The characteristrics we give to 
    the class are:
    
        - the name of the SV (each SV has a different name linked to its type, 
        we do that to differentiate each SV during the reassembly),
        - the type of the SV (INV, INS, DEL, TRA_forward and TRA_back). We differentiate
        TRA_forward and TRA_back (which represents if the sequence has been translocated 
        to the back or not) because the reassembly will be different,
        - the coordinates of each breakpoint linked to the SV on the BAMFILE (there is only one 
        coordinate linked to an insertion, we will put -1 in coordsBP2 and coordsBP3 in this case, same for deletion or inversion which have only two),
        - the size of the SV,
        - the signs for each SV breakpoint (not implemented the detection).
